![PromiseKit](http://methylblue.com/junk/PMKBanner.png)

Modern development is highly asynchronous: isn’t it about time we had tools that made programming asynchronously powerful, easy and delightful?

```swift
UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = true

when(fetchImage(), getLocation()).then { image, location in
    self.imageView.image = image;
    self.label.text = "Buy your cat a house in \(location)"
}.finally {
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = false
}.catch { error in
    UIAlertView(…).show()
}
```

PromiseKit is a thoughtful and complete implementation of promises for iOS and OS X with first-class support for **both** Objective-C *and* Swift.

# Swift 2

The `swift-2.0-beta` branch has a working Swift 2 implementation. Please be aware that both `catch` and `defer` are Swift 2 keywords so we have had to rename these functions and our new choices are not yet final.


# PromiseKit 2

PromiseKit 2 contains many interesting and important additions. Check out our our [release announcement](http://promisekit.org/PromiseKit-2.0-Released/) for full details.


# How To Get Started

* Check out the complete, comprehensive [PromiseKit documentation](http://promisekit.org).
* Read the [API documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/PromiseKit/), (note the documentation is not 100% currently as CocoaDocs is not good with Swift, you may have better luck reading the comments in the sources).
* [Integrate](http://promisekit.org/getting-started) promises into your existing projects.

## Quick Start Guide

### CocoaPods

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod "PromiseKit", "~> 2.0"
```

### Carthage
```ruby
github "mxcl/PromiseKit" ~> 2.0
```

### Standalone Distributions

* [iOS 8 & OS X 10.9  Frameworks](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/releases/download/2.2.2/PromiseKit-2.2.2.zip) (Binaries)

*Please note*, the preferred way to integrate PromiseKit is CocoaPods or Carthage.

###  iOS 7 And Below

Neither CocoaPods or Carthage will install PromiseKit 2 for an iOS 7 target. Your options are:

 1. `pod "PromiseKit", "~> 1.5"` †‡
 2. Use our [iOS 7 EZ-Bake](https://github.com/PromiseKit/EZiOS7)
 3. Download our pre-built static framework (coming soon!)

† There is no Swift support with PromiseKit 1.x installed via CocoaPods.<br>‡ PromiseKit 1.x will work as far back as iOS 5 if required.


# Donations

PromiseKit is hundreds of hours of work almost completely by just me: [Max Howell](https://twitter.com/mxcl). I thoroughly enjoyed making PromiseKit, but nevertheless if you have found it useful then your bitcoin will give me a warm fuzzy feeling from my head right down to my toes: 1JDbV5zuym3jFw4kBCc5Z758maUD8e4dKR.
