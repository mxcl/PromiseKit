 PromiseKit’s configurable parameters.

 Do not change these after any Promise machinery executes as the configuration object is not thread-safe.

 We would like it to be, but sadly `Swift` does not expose `dispatch_once` et al. which is what we used to use in order to make the configuration immutable once first used.
