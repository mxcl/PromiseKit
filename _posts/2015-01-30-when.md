# `when`

Often we need to wait on two or more asynchronous tasks before doing another. Without promises this is messy and fragile:

{% highlight objectivec %}
__block int x = 0;
void (^completionHandler)(id, id) = ^(MKLocalSearchResponse *response, NSError *error){
    if (++x == 2) {
        [self finish];
    }
};
[[[MKLocalSearch alloc] initWithRequest:rq1] startWithCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
[[[MKLocalSearch alloc] initWithRequest:rq2] startWithCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
{% endhighlight %}

As a result, it is often easier to do such tasks in series, ie. one at a time, but this is inefficient since it will likely take twice as long.

With PromiseKit we have `when`:

{% highlight objectivec %}
id search1 = [[[MKLocalSearch alloc] initWithRequest:rq1] promise];
id search2 = [[[MKLocalSearch alloc] initWithRequest:rq2] promise];

[PMKPromise when:@[search1, search2]].then(^(NSArray *results){
    
}).catch(^{
    // called if either search fails
});
{% endhighlight %}

When both promises fulfill, `when` thens the results as an array. If any promise fails, the next catch is called.

<aside>Should you want to wait for all promises to resolve before continuining (should they be fulfilled or rejected both) we provide <code><a class="external-link" href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/PromiseKit/1.4.2/Classes/PMKPromise.html#//api/name/join:">join</a></code>. Note that <code>join</code> is a separate subspec, if you are using CocoaPods you will need to <code>pod "PromiseKit/join"</code></aside>

<hr>

If instead you pass a dictionary to `when`, you will be thenned a dictionary with the same keys mapped to the promise results:

{% highlight objectivec %}
id coffeeSearch = [[MKLocalSearch alloc] initWithRequest:rq1];
id beerSearch = [[MKLocalSearch alloc] initWithRequest:rq2];
id input = @{@"coffee": coffeeSearch, @"beer": beerSearch};

[PMKPromise when:input].then(^(NSDictionary *results){
    id coffeeResults = results[@"coffee"];
});
{% endhighlight %}

<hr>

The array you pass to `when` can be composed of anything. Any promises are allowed to resolve before `when`’s promise is resolved, but any other objects are passed straight through. With this feature we could use a single property as both a promise and its result:

{% highlight objectivec %}
@property id kitten;

- (id)kitten {
    return kitten ?: [PMKPromise new:…];
}

- (void)viewDidAppear {
    [PMKPromise when:self.kitten].then(^(id result){
        // cache the result
        self.kitten = result;
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}
