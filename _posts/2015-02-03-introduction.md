# What is a Promise?

A [promise](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_%28programming%29) represents the future value of an asynchronous task.

# Sorry, what?

A promise is an object that wraps an asynchronous task. Pass that object around, and write clean, ordered code; a logical, simple, modular stream of progression from one asynchronous task to another.

# Right, OK… So Why Should I Care?

Promises are better than alternatives because:

1. They make asynchronous operations chainable and standardized;
2. They clean up asynchronous spaghetti;
3. They simplify error handling;
4. Many objects can be notified about completion, not just one; and
5. They make your apps more robust.

# TL;DR?

Cocoa development can become a mess of asynchronous patterns, asynchronous boilerplate and flakey error handling. Promises solve these problems.
