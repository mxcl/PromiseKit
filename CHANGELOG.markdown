In Swift 2.0 `catch` and `defer` became reserved keywords mandating we rename our functions with these names. This forced a major semantic version change on PromiseKit and thus we took the opportunity to make other minor (source compatability breaking) improvements.

Thus if you cannot afford to adapt to PromiseKit 3 but still want to use Xcode-7.0/Swift-2.0 we provide a [minimal changes branch] where `catch` and `defer` are renamed `catch_` and `defer_` and all other changes are the bare minimum to make PromiseKit 2 compile against Swift 2.

If you still are using Xcode 6 and Swift 1.2 then use PromiseKit 2.

[PromiseKit 2 announcement post](http://promisekit.org/news/2015/05/PromiseKit-2.0-Released/).

# [1.5.0](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/releases/tag/1.5.0)

Swift 1.2 support. Xcode 6.3 required.

# [1.4.1](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/releases/tag/1.4.1)

* Added a `race()` function to the Swift branch.
* Improved the zalgoness of `thenUnleashZalgo()`.
* Split the Swift CocoaPods out so it is completely modular like the objc version.

# [1.4.0](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/releases/tag/1.4.0)

Fixes abound. An additional set of features is a series of new constructors designed to make wrapping existing asynchronous systems easier. Check out `promiseWithAdapter` and company at [cocoadocs.org].

# [1.3.1](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/releases/tag/1.3.1)

The 1.3.1 tag has been pushed, but only for Carthage users. CocoaPods will skip this version most likely with a 1.3.2 release in the near future.
