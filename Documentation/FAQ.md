## How do I create a fulfilled `Void` promise?

```swift
let foo = Promise()

// or:

let bar = Promise.value(())
```

## How do I “early `return`”?

```swift
func foo() -> Promise<Void> {
   guard thingy else {
       return Promise()
   }

    //…
}

func bar() -> Promise<SomethingNotVoid> {
    guard thingy else {
        return .value(instanceOfSomethingNotVoid)
    }
    
    //…
}
```

## Do I need to worry about retain cycles?

Generally, no. Once a promise completes, all handlers are released and so
any references to `self` are also released.

However, if your chain contains side effects that you would typically
not want to happen after, say, a view controller is popped, then you should still
use `weak self` (and check for `self == nil`) to prevent any such side effects.

*However*, in our experience most things that developers consider side effects that
should be protected against are in fact *not* side effects.

Side effects include changes to global application state. They *do not* include
changing the display state of a view-controller. So, protect against setting `UserDefaults` or
modifying the application database, and don't bother protecting against changing
the text in a `UILabel`.

[This StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281214/should-i-use-weak-self-in-promisekit-blocks)
has some good discussion on this topic.

## Do I need to retain my promises?

No. Every promise handler retains its promise until the handler is executed. Once
all handlers have been executed, the promise is deallocated. So you only need to retain
the promise if you need to refer to its final value after its chain has completed.

## Where should I put my `catch`?

`catch` deliberately terminates the chain. You should put it low in your promise
hierarchy at a point as close to the root as possible. Typically, this would be 
somewhere such as a view controller, where your `catch` can then display a message
to the user.

This means you should be writing one catch for many `then`s and returning
promises that do not have internal `catch` handlers of their own.

This is obviously a guideline; do what is necessary.

## How do branched chains work?

Suppose you have a promise:

```
let promise = foo()
```

And you call `then` twice:

```
promise.then {
    // branch A
}

promise.then {
    // branch B
}
```

You now have a branched chain. When `promise` resolves, both chains receive its
value. However, the two chains are entirely separate and Swift will prompt you
to ensure that both have `catch` handlers.

You can most likely ignore the `catch` for one of these branches, but be careful:
in these situations, Swift cannot help you ensure that your chains are error-handled.

```
promise.then {
    // branch A
}.catch { error in
    //…
}

_ = promise.then {
    print("foo")
    
    // ignoring errors here as print cannot error and we handle errors above
}
```

It may be safer to recombine the two branches into a single chain again:

```
let p1 = promise.then {
    // branch A
}

let p2 = promise.then {
    // branch B
}

when(fulfilled: p1, p2).catch { error in
    //…
}
```

> It's worth noting that you can add multiple `catch` handlers to a promise, too.
> And indeed, both will be called if the chain is rejected.

## Is PromiseKit “heavy”?

No. PromiseKit contains hardly any source code. In fact, it is quite lightweight. Any
“weight” relative to other promise implementations derives from 6 years of bug fixes
and tuning, from the fact that we have *stellar* Objective-C-to-Swift bridging and 
from important things such as [Zalgo prevention](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony)
that hobby-project implementations don’t consider.

## Why is debugging hard?

Because promises always execute via dispatch, the backtrace you see at the point of 
an error has less information than is usually required to trace the path of execution.

One solution is to turn off dispatch during debugging:

```swift
// Swift
DispatchQueue.default = zalgo

//ObjC
PMKSetDefaultDispatchQueue(zalgo)
```

Don’t leave this on. In normal use, we always dispatch to avoid you accidentally writing
a common bug pattern. See [this blog post](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony).

## Where is `all()`?

Some promise libraries provide `all` for awaiting multiple results. We call this function
`when`, but it is the same thing. We chose `when` because it's the more common term and
because we think it reads better in code.

## How can I test APIs that return promises?

You need to use `XCTestExpectation`.

We also define `wait()` and `hang()`. Use them if you must, but be careful because they
block the current thread!

## Is PromiseKit thread-safe?

Yes, entirely.

However the code *you* write in your `then`s might not be!

Just make sure you don’t access state outside the chain from concurrent queues.
By default, PromiseKit handlers run on the `main` thread, which is serial, so
you typically won't have to worry about this.

## Why are there separate classes for Objective-C and Swift?

`Promise<T>` is generic and and so cannot be represented by Objective-C.

## Does PromiseKit conform to Promises/A+?

Yes. We have tests that prove this.

## How do PromiseKit and RxSwift/ReactiveSwift differ?

PromiseKit is a lot simpler.

The top-level difference between PromiseKit and RxSwift is that RxSwift `Observable`s (roughly 
analogous to PromiseKit `Promise`s) do not necessarily return a single result: they may emit
zero, one, or an infinite stream of values. This small conceptual change leads to an API
that's both surprisingly powerful and surprisingly complex.

RxSwift requires commitment to a paradigm shift in how you program. It proposes that you
restructure your code as a matrix of interacting value pipelines. When applied properly
to a suitable problem, RxSwift can yield great benefits in robustness and simplicity.
But not all applications are suitable for RxSwift. 

By contrast, PromiseKit selectively applies the best parts of reactive programming
to the hardest part of pure Swift development, the management of asynchronicity. It's a broadly 
applicable tool. Most asynchronous code can be clarified, simplified and made more robust
just by converting it to use promises. (And the conversion process is easy.)

Promises make for code that is clear to most developers. RxSwift, perhaps not. Take a look at this 
[sign-up panel](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxExample/RxExample/Examples/GitHubSignup)
implemented in RxSwift and see what you think. (Note that this is one of RxSwift's own examples.)

Even where PromiseKit and RxSwift are broadly similar, there are many differences in implementation:

* RxSwift has a separate API for chain-terminating elements ("subscribers") versus interior
elements. In PromiseKit, all elements of a chain use roughly the same code pattern.

* The RxSwift API to define an interior element of a chain (an "operator") is hair-raisingly complex.
So, RxSwift tries hard to supply every operator you might ever want to use right off the shelf. There are
hundreds. PromiseKit supplies a few utilities to help with specific scenarios, but because it's trivial
to write your own chain elements, there's no need for all this extra code in the library.

* PromiseKit dispatches the execution of every block. RxSwift dispatches only when told to do so. Moreover, the 
current dispatching state is an attribute of the chain, not the specific block, as it is in PromiseKit.
The RxSwift system is more powerful but more complex. PromiseKit is simple, predictable and safe.

* In PromiseKit, both sides of a branched chain refer back to their shared common ancestors. In RxSwift, 
branching normally creates a duplicate parallel chain that reruns the code at the head of the chain...except 
when it doesn't. The rules for determining what will actually happen are complex, and given
a chain created by another chunk of code, you can't really tell what the behavior will be.

* Because RxSwift chains don't necessarily terminate on their own, RxSwift needs you to take on some
explicit garbage collection duties to ensure that pipelines that are no longer needed are properly
deallocated. All promises yield a single value, terminate and then automatically deallocate themselves.

You can find some additional discussion in [this ticket](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/issues/484).

## Why can’t I return from a catch like I can in JavaScript?

Swift demands that functions have one purpose. Thus, we have two error handlers:

* `catch`: ends the chain and handles errors
* `recover`: attempts to recover from errors in a chain

You want `recover`.

## When do promises “start”?

Often people are confused about when Promises “start”. Is it immediately? Is it
later? Is it when you call `then`?

The answer is: The promise **body** executes during initialization of the promise, on the current thread.
As an example, `"Executing the promise body"` will be printed to the console right after the promise is created,
without having to call `then` on the promise.

```swift
let testPromise = Promise<Bool> {
    print("Executing the promise body.")
    return $0.fulfill(true)
}
```

But what about asynchronous tasks that you create in your promise's body? They behave the same way as they would
without using PromiseKit. Here's a simple example:

```swift
let testPromise = Promise<Bool> { seal in
    print("Executing the promise body.")
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3.0) {
        print("Executing asyncAfter.")
        return seal.fulfill(true)
    }
}
```

The message `"Executing the promise body."` is being logged right away, but the message `"Executing asyncAfter."`
is only logged three seconds later. In this case `DispatchQueue` is responsible for deciding when to execute
the task you pass to it, PromiseKit has nothing to do with it.

## What is a good way to use Firebase with PromiseKit

There is no good way to use Firebase with PromiseKit. See the next question for
a more detailed rationale.

The best option is to embed your chain in your Firebase handler:

```
foo.observe(.value) { snapshot in
    firstly {
        bar(with: snapshot)
    }.then {
        baz()
    }.then {
        baffle()
    }.catch {
        //…
    }
}
```


## I need my `then` to fire multiple times

Then we’re afraid you cannot use PromiseKit for that event. Promises only
resolve *once*. This is the fundamental nature of promises and it is considered a
feature because it gives you guarantees about the flow of your chains.


## How do I change the default queues that handlers run on?

You can change the values of `PromiseKit.conf.Q`. There are two variables that
change the default queues that the two kinds of handler run on. A typical
pattern is to change all your `then`-type handlers to run on a background queue
and to have all your “finalizers” run on the main queue:

```
PromiseKit.conf.Q.map = .global()
PromiseKit.conf.Q.return = .main  //NOTE this is the default
```

Be very careful about setting either of these queues to `nil`.  It has the
effect of running *immediately*, and this is not what you usually want to do in
your application.  This is, however, useful when you are running specs and want
your promises to resolve immediately. (This is basically the same idea as "stubbing"
an HTTP request.)

```swift
// in your test suite setup code
PromiseKit.conf.Q.map = nil
PromiseKit.conf.Q.return = nil
```

## How do I use PromiseKit on the server side?

If your server framework requires that the main queue remain unused (e.g., Kitura),
then you must use PromiseKit 6 and you must tell PromiseKit not to dispatch to the
main queue by default. This is easy enough:

```swift
PromiseKit.conf.Q = (map: DispatchQueue.global(), return: DispatchQueue.global())
```

> Note, we recommend using your own queue rather than `.global()`, we've seen better performance this way.

Here’s a more complete example:

```swift
import Foundation
import HeliumLogger
import Kitura
import LoggerAPI
import PromiseKit

HeliumLogger.use(.info)

let pmkQ = DispatchQueue(label: "pmkQ", qos: .default, attributes: .concurrent, autoreleaseFrequency: .workItem)
PromiseKit.conf.Q = (map: pmkQ, return: pmkQ)

let router = Router()
router.get("/") { _, response, next in
    Log.info("Request received")
    after(seconds: 1.0).done {
        Log.info("Sending response")
        response.send("OK")
        next()
    }
}

Log.info("Starting server")
Kitura.addHTTPServer(onPort: 8888, with: router)
Kitura.run()
```

## How do I control console output?

By default PromiseKit emits console messages when certain events occur.  These events include:
- A promise or guarantee has blocked the main thread
- A promise has been deallocated without being fulfilled
- An error which occurred while fulfilling a promise was swallowed using cauterize

You may turn off or redirect this output by setting a thread safe closure in [PMKConfiguration](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/blob/master/Sources/Configuration.swift) **before** processing any promises. For example, to turn off console output:

```swift
conf.logHandler = { event in }
```
