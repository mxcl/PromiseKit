## Why should I use PromiseKit over X-Promises-Foo?

* PromiseKit has a heavy focus on **developer-experience**. You’re a developer, do you care about your experience? Yes? Then pick PromiseKit.
* Do you care about having any bugs you find fixed? Then pick PromiseKit.
* Do you care about having your input heard and reacted to in a fast fashion? Then pick PromiseKit.
* Do you want a library that has been maintained continuously and passionately for 6 years? Then pick PromiseKit.
* Do you want a library that the community has chosen to be their №1 Promises/Futures library? Then pick PromiseKit.
* Do you want to be able to use Promises with Apple’s SDKs rather than have to do all the work of writing the Promise implementations yourself? Then pick PromiseKit.
* Do you want to be able to use Promises with Swift 3.x, Swift 4.x, ObjC, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS Android, & Linux? Then pick PromiseKit.

## Do I need to worry about retain cycles?

Generally no, provided the promise completes then all handlers are released thus
any references to `self` are also released.

However, if your chain contains side-effects that you would typically
not want to happen after, say, a view controller is popped then you should still
use `weak self` (and check for `self == nil`) to prevent any such side-effects.

*However*, in our experience most things that developers consider side-effects that
should be protected against are in fact *not* side-effects.

Side-effects include: changes to global application state. They *do not* include
changing the view of a viewController. So, protect against setting UserDefaults or
modifying the application database, and don't bother protecting against changing
the text in a `UILabel`.

[This stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281214/should-i-use-weak-self-in-promisekit-blocks)
has some good discussion on the topic.

## Where should I put my `catch`?

`catch` deliberately terminates the chain, you should place low in your promise
hierarchy: at as-root a point as possible. Typically this would be your view
controllers where your `catch` can then display a message to the user.

This means you should be writing one catch for many `then`s and be returning
promises without there being `catch` handlers.

This is obviously a guideline, do what is necessary.

## How do branched chains work?

If you have a promise:

```
let promise = foo()
```

And you call `then` twice:

```
promise.then {
    // branch A
}

promise.then {
    // branch B
}
```

You now have a branched chain. When `promise` resolves both chains receive its
value. However the two chains are entirely separate and Swift will prompt you
to ensure both have `catch` handlers.

Probably, however, you can ignore the catch for one, but be careful in these
situations as Swift cannot help you ensure your chains are error-handled.

```
promise.then {
    // branch A
}.catch { error in
    //…
}

_ = promise.then {
    print("foo")
    
    // ignoring errors here as print cannot error and we handle errors above
}
```

It may be safer to recombine the two branches into a single chain again:

```
let p1 = promise.then {
    // branch A
}

let p2 = promise.then {
    // branch B
}

when(fulfilled: p1, p2).catch { error in
    //…
}
```

> It's worth noting that you can add multiple `catch` handlers to a promise too,
> and indeed, both will be called if the chain is rejected.

## Is PromiseKit “heavy”?

No, PromiseKit is hardly any sources in fact, it is “light-weight”. Any
“weight” relative to other promise implementations is 6 years of bug fixes, the
fact we have *stellar* Objective-C to Swift bridging or important things like
[Zalgo prevention](http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony)
that hobby-project implementations don’t consider.

## Why is debugging hard?

Because promises always execute via `dispatch` the backtraces you get have less
information than is often required to trace the path of execution.

One solution is (during debugging) to turn off the dispatch:

```swift
// Swift
DispatchQueue.default = zalgo

//ObjC
PMKSetDefaultDispatchQueue(zalgo)
```

Don’t leave this on, we always dispatch to avoid you accidentally writing
a common bug pattern: http://blog.izs.me/post/59142742143/designing-apis-for-asynchrony

## Where is `all()`?

Some promise libraries provide `all`, we provide `when`, it is the same. `when`
was chosen as it is the more common choice which we also think reads better.


## How can I test APIs that return promises?

You need to use `XCTestExpectation`.

We also provide `.wait()` and `hang()`, if you must, but be careful as they
block the current thread!

## Is PromiseKit thread-safe?

Yes, entirely.

However the code *you* write in your `then`s might not be!

Just make sure you don’t access state outside the chain from concurrent queues.
By default PromiseKit handlers run on the `main` thread, which is serial, so
typically you won't have to worry about this.

## Why are there separate classes for Objective-C and Swift?

`Promise<T>` is generic and and thus cannot be represented by Objective-C.

## Does PromiseKit conform to Promises/A+?

Yes, we have tests that prove this.

## How do PromiseKit and RxSwift differ?

https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/issues/484

## Why can’t I return from a catch like I can in Javascript?

Swift demands functions with one purpose, thus we have two error handlers:

* `catch`: ends the chain and handles errors
* `recover`: attempts to recover from errors in a chain

You want `recover`.

## When do promises “start”?

Often people are confused about when Promises “start”. Is it immediately? Is it
later? Is it when you call then?

The answer is: promises do not choose when the underlying task they represent
starts. That is up to that task. For example here is the code for a simple
promise that wraps Alamofire:


```swift
func foo() -> Promise<Any>
    return Promise { seal in
        Alamofire.request(rq).responseJSON { rsp in
            seal.resolve(rsp.value, rsp.error)
        }
    }
}
```

Who chooses when this promise starts? The answer is: Alamofire does and in this
case, it “starts” immediately when `foo()` is called.

## What is a good way to use Firebase with PromiseKit

There is no good way to use Firebase with PromiseKit. See the next question for rationale.

The best option is to embed your chain in your firebase handler:

```
foo.observe(.value) { snapshot in
    firstly {
        bar(with: snapshot)
    }.then {
        baz()
    }.then {
        baffle()
    }.catch {
        //…
    }
}
```


## I need my `then` to fire multiple times

Then we’re afraid that you cannot use PromiseKit for that event. Promises only
resolve `once`, this is the fundamental nature of promises and is considered a
feature since it gives you guarantees about the flow of your chains.


## How do I change the default queues that handlers run upon?

You can change the values of `PromiseKit.conf.Q`, there are two variables that
change the defaults that the two kinds of handler run upon. Thus a typical
pattern is to change all your `then`-type handlers to run in a background queue
and have all your “finalizers” run on the main queue:

```
PromiseKit.conf.Q.map = .global()
PromiseKit.conf.Q.return = .main  //NOTE this is the default
```


## How do I use PromiseKit server-side?

If your server framework requires the main-queue remain unused (eg. Kitura) then you must use
PromiseKit 6 and you must tell PromiseKit to not dispatch to the main-queue by default. This
is easy enough:

```swift
PromiseKit.conf.Q = (map: DispatchQueue.global(), return: DispatchQueue.global())
```

Here’s a more full example:

```swift
import Foundation
import HeliumLogger
import Kitura
import LoggerAPI
import PromiseKit

HeliumLogger.use(.info)

PromiseKit.conf.Q = (map: DispatchQueue.global(), return: DispatchQueue.global())

let router = Router()
router.get("/") { _, response, next in
    Log.info("Request received")
    after(seconds: 1.0).done {
        Log.info("Sending response")
        response.send("OK")
        next()
    }
}

Log.info("Starting server")
Kitura.addHTTPServer(onPort: 8888, with: router)
Kitura.run()
```
