/**
A `Promise` represents the future value of a task.

To obtain the value of a `Promise`, call `then`. When the asynchronous task that this `Promise` represents has resolved successfully, the block you pass to `then` will be executed with the resolved value. If the `Promise` has already been resolved succesfully at the time you `then` the `Promise`, the block will be executed immediately.

Effective use of Promises involves chaining `then`s, where the return value from one `then` is fed as the value of the next, et cetera.

For a thorough overview of Promises, @see http://promisekit.org

/**
The pattern of Promises is defined by the method: `then`.

Provide a block to `then`, your block may take one or no arguments, and return an object or have no return value. We use block introspection to provide such flexibility.

Returning from your block will resolve the next `Promise` with that value.

If an exception is thrown inside your block, or you return an `NSError` object the next `Promise` will be rejected. @see `catch` for documentation on error handling.

Then is always executed on the main dispatch queue (i.e the main/UI thread).

@see `-thenOn`

The returned Promise is rejected immediately if *any* of the `Promise`s received by `when` fail, discarding all other Promise values (thus you only get one error in any catch handler you provide).

The returned `Promise` is resolved with an array of results indexed as the original array passed to when. If you pass a single value to when, you will not get an array in subsequent `then`s.

Loops until one or more promises have resolved.

Because Promises are single-shot, the block to until must return one or more promises. They are then `when`â€™d. If they succeed the until loop is concluded. If they fail then the @param `catch` handler is executed.

If the `catch` throws or returns an `NSError` then the loop is ended.

If the `catch` handler returns a Promise then re-execution of the loop is suspended upon resolution of that Promise. If the Promise succeeds then the loop continues. If it fails the loop ends.

An example usage is an app starting up that must get data from the Internet before the main ViewController can be shown. You can `until` the poll Promise and in the catch handler decide if the poll should be reattempted or not, perhaps returning a `UIAlertView.promise` allowing the user to choose if they continue or not.
