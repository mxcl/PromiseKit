/**
A `Promise` represents the future value of a task.

To obtain the value of a `Promise`, call `then`. When the asynchronous task that this `Promise` represents has resolved successfully, the block you pass to `then` will be executed with the resolved value. If the `Promise` has already been resolved succesfully at the time you `then` the `Promise`, the block will be executed immediately.

Effective use of Promises involves chaining `then`s, where the return value from one `then` is fed as the value of the next, et cetera.

For a thorough overview of Promises, @see http://promisekit.org

The pattern of Promises is defined by the method: `then`.

Provide a block to `then`, your block may take one or no arguments, and return an object or have no return value. We use block introspection to provide such flexibility.

Returning from your block will resolve the next `Promise` with that value.

If an exception is thrown inside your block, or you return an `NSError` object the next `Promise` will be rejected. @see `catch` for documentation on error handling.

Then is always executed on the main dispatch queue (i.e the main/UI thread).
